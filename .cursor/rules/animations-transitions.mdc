# Animation & Transitions - Development Rules

## Core Animation Principles

### Speed Guidelines
- **Fast animations are better** - keep them snappy
- **Maximum duration**: 300ms for any animation
- **Default approach**: Prioritize CSS transitions over animation libraries
- **Library of choice**: Framer Motion (when CSS transitions aren't sufficient)

## Easing Functions

### CSS Easing Reference
- **`ease-out`**: Fast start, slow down - **primary choice for most animations**
- **`ease-in-out`**: Slow start, speed up, slow end - **use for elements already on screen**
- **`ease`**: Starts faster and ends slower than ease-in-out - **use for hover states**
- **`linear`**: Constant motion - **use for non-interactive elements only**
- **`ease-in`**: Slow start then speed up - **avoid (feels sluggish)**

## Timing Guidelines

### Context-Specific Durations
- **Loading animations**: Never slow - keep under 200ms
- **Hover transitions**: 150ms (user's eyes already focused on element)
- **Modal enter**: 200ms
- **Modal/popover exit**: 150ms
- **Large/full-size components**: Increase duration proportionally

### Human Perception Baseline
- **Visual reaction time**: 215ms
- **Sweet spot range**: 200-300ms
- **Hover interactions**: 150ms (faster due to focused attention)
